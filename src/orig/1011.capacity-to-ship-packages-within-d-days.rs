 *
 * A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another
 * within D days.
 * 
 * The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day,
 * we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by
 * weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of
 * the ship.
 * 
 * Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the
 * packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: 
 * A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like
 * this:
 * 1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 * 2nd day: 6, 7
 * 3rd day: 8
 * 4th day: 9
 * 5th day: 10
 * 
 * Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of
 * capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6,
 * 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: 
 * A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like
 * this:
 * 1st day: 3, 2
 * 2nd day: 2, 4
 * 3rd day: 1, 4
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * 1st day: 1
 * 2nd day: 2
 * 3rd day: 3
 * 4th day: 1, 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
 * 1 <= weights[i] <= 500
 *
