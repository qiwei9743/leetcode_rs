# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
#
# Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path
# could represent a number.
# 
# An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
# 
# Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
# 
# Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3]
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   3
# Output: 25
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
# The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
# Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
# ⁠   4
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 9   0
# / \
# 5   1
# Output: 1026
# Explanation:
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
# The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
# Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(root, n):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            cur = n * 10 + root.val
            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                return cur
            return dfs(root.left, cur) + dfs(root.right, cur)

        return dfs(root, 0)
