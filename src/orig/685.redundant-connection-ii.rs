 * In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is
 * exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes are descendants of
 * this node, plus every node has exactly one parent, except for the root node
 * which has no parents.
 * 
 * The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with N
 * nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional directed edge
 * added.  The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and
 * was not an edge that already existed.
 * 
 * The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges.  Each element of edges
 * is a pair [u, v] that represents a directed edge connecting nodes u and v,
 * where u is a parent of child v.
 * 
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a rooted
 * tree of N nodes.  If there are multiple answers, return the answer that
 * occurs last in the given 2D-array.
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
 * ⁠ 1
 * ⁠/ \
 * v   v
 * 2-->3
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,1], [1,5]]
 * Output: [4,1]
 * Explanation: The given directed graph will be like this:
 * 5  2
 * ⁠    ^    |
 * ⁠    |    v
 * ⁠    4 
 * 
 * Note:
 * The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
 * Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N
 * is the size of the input array.
